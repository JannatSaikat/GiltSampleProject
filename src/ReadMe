Done:
Added Log4j dependency to remove log4j error in the console
Updated Selenium Java dependency to the latest version
Added an AfterMethod, to quit the browser after each test
Test 2: fixed assertion point, so the expected result == actual result
Test 3: added synchronization step to wait for the element &  fixed  the locator
